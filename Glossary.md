### 🛡️ Core Concepts & Privacy
*   **Anonymity:** The state of remaining unknown. The app ensures no personal data is stored, identifying users only through unique codes.
*   **Camouflage Mode (Incognito):** A privacy feature that disguises the app’s interface as a common tool (e.g., a calculator or music player) to hide its true purpose from potential aggressors.
*   **Ephemeral Data Management:** The process of automatically deleting trip data once the journey is completed to protect user privacy.
*   **Hidden Gestures:** Specific, non-obvious touch actions (like swiping with two fingers) used to trigger emergency functions or exit Camouflage Mode.
*   **Institutional Distribution:** A restricted release model where the app is provided only through official government or local council channels rather than public app stores.
*   **Unique User Code:** A specific alphanumeric identifier provided by the authorities that links the app to a person’s identity only within official records, keeping the app server "blind."

### 🗺️ Navigation & Prevention
*   **Automatic Arrival Notification:** A local feature that sends a predefined SMS to emergency contacts once the GPS confirms the user has reached her destination.
*   **Deviation Alert (Monitor Mode):** A safety check triggered if the GPS detects a sudden change in route, a long stop, or an unusual change in speed.
*   **Fake Call Simulator:** A deterrent tool that mimics an incoming phone call with pre-recorded audio to discourage potential followers.
*   **Safe Havens (Refuge Points):** Local businesses (pharmacies, bars, gas stations) officially partnered with the city to provide a safe space and assistance for women in distress.
*   **Safe Route:** A suggested navigation path that prioritizes well-lit streets, areas with surveillance cameras, and high-traffic pedestrian zones over the shortest distance.

### 🤝 Community & Support
*   **Companion Identity Validation:** A security protocol (using a specific screen color or a "watchword") to ensure that two users meeting to walk together are who they claim to be.
*   **Peer Support Network:** A feature that alerts nearby verified users when someone starts a journey, allowing for digital or physical accompaniment.
*   **Physical Encounter:** A voluntary agreement between two users with similar routes to meet and walk together for increased safety.
*   **Safe Chat:** A built-in messaging system for users to coordinate encounters, including a reporting tool for inappropriate behavior.

### 🚨 Emergency Systems
*   **Dead Man's Switch (High Tension Mode):** A safety feature requiring the user to keep a finger on the screen. If the finger is removed and a PIN is not entered, an emergency alarm is triggered.
*   **Encrypted A/V Recording:** The automatic capturing of audio and video during an emergency. The file is encrypted and sent directly to authorities; it cannot be accessed by the user or third parties.
*   **Grace Period (Courtesy Countdown):** A 10-second window after pressing the panic button that allows the user to cancel a false alarm before the police are notified.
*   **Hardware Activation:** The ability to trigger an alarm using physical phone components, such as pressing the power button multiple times or shaking the device.
*   **Panic Button:** A high-visibility interface element that, when activated, alerts police, nearby users, and emergency contacts simultaneously.
*   **Security PIN:** A personal code required to cancel alarms, confirm safety after a deviation, or exit high-security modes.

### 📊 Urbanism & Feedback
*   **Anonymous Reporting Pins:** User-placed markers on a map used to report urban issues like "poor lighting" or "intimidating groups" without revealing the user's identity.
*   **Heat Maps:** Visual data representations provided to city officials showing areas where users feel most or least safe, used to improve urban planning and policing.
*   **Urban Safety Feedback:** A post-trip survey where users rate their perception of safety during their journey.
